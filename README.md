# Paint-GUI
The Paint Clone project aims to create a simple drawing application similar to the classic MS Paint using Python with the help of the tkinter and PIL (Python Imaging Library) modules. This project will allow users to draw various shapes, lines, and colors on a canvas, as well as save and load images.
