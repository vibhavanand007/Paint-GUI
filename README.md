# Paint-GUI
The Paint Clone project aims to create a simple drawing application similar to the classic MS Paint using Python with the help of the tkinter and PIL (Python Imaging Library) modules. This project will allow users to draw various shapes, lines, and colors on a canvas, as well as save and load images.
Here's a basic outline of the features and functionalities of the Paint Clone:
  [Graphical User Interface (GUI), Drawing Tools, Color Selection, Saving and       Loading Images, Error Handling]
By implementing these features, users will be able to create simple drawings and sketches directly within the Python environment using the Paint Clone application. This project provides a hands-on learning experience with GUI development using tkinter, image processing with PIL, and handling user interactions in Python.
